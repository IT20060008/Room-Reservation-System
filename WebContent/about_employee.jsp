<h2>Qualifications Required for Hotel Management</h2> 

<p>A hotel manager can mean the difference between a vacation that's enjoyable or disappointing, and a hotel's smooth operation can require several types of managers. General managers oversee property functions ranging from guest satisfaction to budgets. Revenue managers supervise finances, while front-office managers coordinate reservations and supervise desk clerks. Regardless of their type, hotel managers must meet specific qualifications in education, experience and skills.</p> 

<h2>Job Description</h2>  

<p>Hotel managers need specific skill sets to handle the many facets of the job. People skills are imperative, because hotel managers must know how to understand and satisfy the needs of customers and employees alike. Listening skills help hotel managers to determine guest concerns, while customer-service and problem-solving skills give them judgment to choose the best course of action. To motivate and guide hotel staff and resolve conflicts, leadership and managerial abilities are a must. Plus, hotel managers juggle every aspect of a property’s operation, from schedules to budgets to human resources, so organizational skills are essential. Top hotel managers in executive positions focus on sales and marketing, accounting, computer systems and administration. 
</p>
<h2>Education Requirements</h2>  

<p>Managers of larger or full-service hotels typically need a bachelor’s degree in hospitality or hotel management. However, hotels with fewer services and less complicated operations may hire candidates with an associate’s degree or a certificate in hotel management. Although more than 500 U.S. schools offer training in hotel management, only 100 curricula are qualified through the Accreditation Commission for Programs in Hospitality Administration. Hotel management programs usually require courses in administration, accounting, economics, electronic reservation systems, marketing, housekeeping, food and beverage management and maintenance. Students who want a head start can look for a high school that offers the two-year Lodging Management Program of the American Hotel and Lodging Educational Institute.
</p>
<h2>  Industry Salaries</h2>  

<p>Hotel management jobs are available in many types of lodging. Salaries vary according to industry, level of responsibility and geographic location. Hotel managers earned a median annual income of $51,840, as of May 2016, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The bottom 10 percent of earners in the field earned around $28,870, while the top 10 percent earned over $96,570. New Jersey-based hotel managers had the highest average annual pay by state, $102,400. Salaries were also higher than average in District of Columbia, at $101,970, and Virginia, at $80,540. By industry, hotel managers in larger establishment earned the most, with an average annual wage of $98,570. </p>

<h2>Experience and Training </h2>

<p>Hotel management isn’t a job that students land right out of undergraduate school. Most properties prefer managers with on-the-job experience in a series of increasingly responsible positions. A desk clerk, for example, might get promoted to chief room clerk, then to assistant front office manager, front office manager, sales and promotion manager and finally, hotel manager. Employers typically reserve management-training spots for college-educated candidates, though employees who show leadership potential and have several years of experience can sometimes move into assistant manager jobs. Aspiring hotel managers should look for experience through part-time summer jobs and internships.</p>

<h2>Job Trend Outlook </h2>

<p>Jobs for hotel managers will grow 4 percent from 2016 to 2026, slower than the average growth of 7 percent for all jobs, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Though the tourism industry will expand, the hotel sector will move toward more limited-service properties with fewer amenities and features to manage. What’s more, hotel operators are scaling back on management to slash costs. Employment prospects will be best at smaller hotels, which see fewer competitors for management openings. Managers with a four-year degree in hotel management will have the best shot at jobs, especially inside luxury hotels.</p>

<h2>Types of Hotel Positions </h2>

<p>Whether they're traveling for business or pleasure, hotel guests want a positive experience. That's where hotel employees come in. From the bellhop that greets them at the door to the manager who makes sure operations run seamlessly, hotel workers affect whether guests' memories are positive or negative. With the exception of managers, most workers in the industry make less than the 2017 U.S. average annual salary of $50,620. </p>

<h2>Managers </h2>

<p>Efficiency, profits and guest experience – hotel managers are responsible for it all. Managers inspect guest rooms and grounds for cleanliness, greet and register guests, set room rates, track cash flow and handle customer queries and complaints. Types of managers include general managers, revenue managers, front-office managers and convention-service managers. To land a manager’s job in a large, full-service hotel, you need a bachelor’s degree in the field. Smaller operations require an associate degree, or a high school diploma and several years of experience working in a hotel. Lodging managers earned a median annual wage of $51,800 as of May 2017, and an average of $59,620, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The bottom 10 percent of earners made less than $28,930, while the top 10 percent made over $98,370.</p>

<h2>Clerks </h2>

<p>Desk clerks are at the front line of customer service. They make and confirm reservations, and greet, register and assign rooms to guests. Desk clerks issue room keys and give escort instructions to bellhops. They also contact housekeeping or maintenance when guests report problems. These hotel workers keep track of guest accounts, handle bookkeeping and collect guest payments. Most desk clerks have a high school diploma or less. Desk clerks took home a median annual income of $24,250 and an average of $22,850, as of May 2017. The bottom 10 percent of earners made under $17,670. The top 10 percent made over $32,810 </p>


<h2>Bellhops</h2>

<p>Bellhops and baggage porters take luggage to guest rooms. They provide weighing and billing services for shipments of baggage, mail and parcels. They help disabled guests with special needs. These lodging workers also complete baggage insurance forms, issue charge slips for services and keep records. Most bellhops and baggage porters have a high school diploma or less. The median annual income for baggage porters and bellhops as of May 2017 was $23,230, with an average of $26,100; the bottom 10 percent of earners got less than $18,160, and the top 10 percent were paid more than $38,250 </p>

<h2>Maids</h2>

<p>Maids and housekeeping cleaners keep rooms clean and comfortable. They make beds, vacuum rooms, empty trashcans, deliver ironing boards or rollaway beds and replenish soaps, shampoos and other supplies. They have to lift and move lightweight objects. Hotels don’t have formal education requirements for maids; training happens on the job, under experienced maids. Maids and housekeeping cleaners, including those who worked in hotels, earned a median of $22,860 and an average of $24,630 as of May 2017. For the bottom 10 percent of earners, earnings were under $17,720. For the top 10 percent, earnings were over $35,080.</p>

<h2>Industry Outlook </h2>

<p>The BLS expects the number of management jobs in hotels to show growth of 4 percent between 2016 and 2026, which is slower than the expansion rate for all jobs. Sluggish growth will come from increasing numbers of limited-service hotels and streamlined operations to cut expenses. The increase in maids and housekeepers will be 6 percent, which is about average. Jobs for desk clerks and baggage porters will show slow growth between 2 percent and 4 percent for the same period. </p>

<h2>Education Requirements for Hotel Management </h2>

<p>The road to hotel management begins with an educational background in hospitality management. Responsible for all facets of running a hotel, a hotel manager must understand marketing, food service, sales, finance, customer service, employee relations and facility operations. A college degree in hospitality management and practical experience provides a solid foundation for success in hotel management. </p>

<h2>Job Description </h2>

<p>The job of a hotel manager is centered on ensuring each guest has a positive experience. This starts with the appearance of the building and ends with the ease of checking out. A hotel manager oversees a large employee base that takes care of housekeeping, front desk service, catering, food service and maintenance. Each day, a hotel manager interacts with guests and manages problems. Since so much goes into the inner workings of a hotel, a manager must be able to multitask and effectively delegate responsibilities </p>

<h2>Education Requirements</h2>

<h3>College Degree</h3>

<p>An undergraduate degree in hospitality business education is the best preparation for hotel management. In addition to general college curriculum, you'll take courses in service management, food management, hospitality accounting, human resources and facilities maintenance. Electives provide an opportunity to specialize in areas like marketing, food service operations, the casino industry, event planning and club operations. This four-year program culminates with an internship in a hotel to provide practical application of classroom learning. A hospitality business degree provides a solid background in leadership and all facets of hotel operations.</p>

<h3>Certificate Program</h3>

<p>If you're already working in a hotel and would like to be considered for a management position, a hospitality management certificate program may be a convenient choice. Many certificate programs are offered online to allow working students to maximize their time. Spanning three months of time, a hospitality management certificate covers topics like finance, revenue management, customer service, marketing and teamwork. </p>

<h3>Experience</h3>

<p>While uncommon, you may be able to become a hotel manager through experience and on-the-job training. Some companies will select talented employees to participate in a management training program. Most trainees have college degrees in complementary subjects like business or marketing, but it's possible to be selected for a training program because of outstanding job performance.</p>
